# Air-Hokey-Game
Air Hokey Game with JOGL , it's a simulation for the real air hockey game.

You will have fun playing it as you will find out that this game has the same features such like the real one , maybe better.

# Some features:

**1-single-Mode:**

In the real game you should have company **"another player"** to be able to play , but in our simulation version you will be able to play alone as we provide to you an **AI** system that will play with you in the case you are alone.

**2-levels:**

We provide the challenges you are looking for as you can choose the level of the AI to see how good your playing is.

**3-Multi-Mode:**

just as the real game , you will be able to play with a friend of yours.

**4-High Score:**

when we play any game with our friends we maybe argue about how many times we won , aren't we all do that ?

but here you can open the high score screen and see how many times you won.

**5-Pause:**

If something emergency happen and you were in the middle of a game you can easily pause the game and resume it when you finish.
