# Air Hokey Game

Air Hokey Game with **OpenGL**, a simple simulation for the real air hockey game.

You will have fun playing it as you will find out that this game has the same features such like the real one, maybe
better.

### Some features

- **Single Mode**

  In the real game you should have company **Another Player** to be able to play, but in our version you will be able to
  play alone as we provide to you an **AI** system that will play with you in the case you are alone.


- **Two Players Mode**

  Just as the real game, you will be able to play with a friend of yours.


- **Levels**

  The game provides the challenges you are looking for as you can choose the level of the AI to see how good your
  playing is.


- **High Score**

  When you play any game with your friends you maybe argue about how many times they won, aren't we all do that? But
  here you can open the high score screen and see how many times you won.


- **Pause**

  If something happen, and you were in the middle of a game you can easily pause the game and resume it when you finish.

### Languages & Libraries

- **Java**
